# Hello! 👋 Ik ben Gofer Ai!

I'm Gopher Ai(InkkaPlum), I'm keen on exploring the fields of computer science(CS).

## Important Update

Due to significant personal life changes, I won’t be able to update any tutorial/content-creation material for the foreseeable future (likely several years).

I’m sorry it took me this long to properly explain.

I’m doing well—just extremely busy over the past year, and the coming years will be equally demanding.

Moving forward, this repository will **primarily host**:

- Uni Assignments
- Personal projects
- Personal learning records
- Portfolio projects

Existing tutorials will remain available for reference, but no new educational content will be added.

If my circumstances change in the future, I may consider resuming updates.

Thank you again for your understanding and kindness.

## Skills

- Web Development (Front-end and Back-end)
- Unity Development
- Mainly used programming languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, PHP, C#
